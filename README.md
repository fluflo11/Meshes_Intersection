## Parsing 
### Nodes

Node parser is directly implemented as a static function of the Point2D class.
### Topology
Topology parser is also implemented as a static function of the Topology class. It directly creates a Topology object. Use : 
```cpp
Topology my_topology = Topology::getInputTopology(input_file);
my_topology.printTopology();
```
